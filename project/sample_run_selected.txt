         WELCOME TO THE CMPT 120 Scantron Processing Program!!!
         ======================================================

The data files in this folder are 15
There are 21 questions
The answer key is:
D B A B B A B A B A B B D B B C E A C D A 
The points are:
1.0 1.5 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.5 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.5 1.0 1.0 0.5 1.0 1.0 1.0 
The maximum points available are 25.0

You have to choose one of the two options
Type ALL if you want to process all students
Type SEL if you want to process selected students
Type here:sdf
PLEASE TYPE IN ALL OR SEL!:sel
Type a name or END to finish ==> AAAAA
Student AAAAA got 16.0 points
Type a name or END to finish ==> EEE
Student EEE got 15.5 points
Type a name or END to finish ==> JJJJ
Student JJJJ got 16.5 points
Type a name or END to finish ==> JK
student not in database, type again
Type a name or END to finish ==> K
Student K got 19.5 points
Type a name or END to finish ==> LLLL
Student LLLL got 13.5 points
Type a name or END to finish ==> END
All your selected students have been processed!


 Here is the output that will be saved in the folder!

"AAAAA",16.0,64.0

"EEE",15.5,62.0

"JJJJ",16.5,66.0

"K",19.5,78.0

"LLLL",13.5,54.0


Here are the statistics

The maxiimum points are: 19.5
The average points are: 16.2
The number of students processed are: 5
The number of times each question was answered correctly:
[5, 5, 4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 4, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 3]
The most difficult questions [9, 10, 11]
Distribution points are [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 0, 0]
Considering the ranges [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
Would you like to plot a graph of the distribution?, Y/N:n
Would you like to calculate the distance between the questions? Y/N:y

Special analysis 2 questions!

This will provide a 'distance' between two questions by accumulating the distance within each student, for all students.
You can check distances between several pairs of questions>
Please type in the starting question, from q1 to q21:20
Please type in the ending question, from q1 to q21:21
TRACE, for student GREAT the dist is 1
TRACE, for student AAAAA the dist is 1
TRACE, for student BBB the dist is 0
TRACE, for student CCCCCC the dist is 0
TRACE, for student DDDD the dist is 0
TRACE, for student EEE the dist is 0
TRACE, for student FFFFFF the dist is 0
TRACE, for student GGGG the dist is 1
TRACE, for student HHH the dist is 1
TRACE, for student II the dist is 0
TRACE, for student JJJJ the dist is 1
TRACE, for student K the dist is 0
TRACE, for student LLLL the dist is 1
TRACE, for student MMMM the dist is 0
TRACE, for student NNNN the dist is 0

The distance between 20 and 21 is: 6
Do you want to continue for some other distances? Y/N:n

All stats are done, bye!
